        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p>
          These Terms of Service Terms govern your use of our website and
          services. By accessing or using our services, you agree to be bound by
          these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use our
          services.
        </p>
        <h2>Use of Services</h2>
        <p>
          You must follow any policies made available to you within the
          services. Do not misuse our services. For example, do not interfere
          with our services or try to access them using a method other than the
          interface and the instructions that we provide. You may use our
          services only as permitted by law, including applicable export and
          re-export control laws and regulations.
        </p>
        <h2>Your Account</h2>
        <p>
          You may need an account in order to use some of our services. You are
          responsible for protecting your account by keeping your password
          confidential. You are also responsible for the activity that happens
          on or through your account.
        </p>
        <h2>Privacy and Copyright Protection</h2>
        <p>
          Our privacy policies explain how we treat your personal data and
          protect your privacy when you use our services. By using our services,
          you agree that we can use such data in accordance with our privacy
          policies. We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and
          terminate accounts of repeat infringers according to the process set
          out in the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
        </p>
        <h2>Content in Our Services</h2>
        <p>
          Our services display some content that is not ours. This content is
          the sole responsibility of the entity that makes it available. We may
          review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our
          policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content that we
          reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But that does not
          necessarily mean that we review content, so please do not assume that
          we do.
        </p>
        <h2>Modifying and Terminating Our Services</h2>
        <p>
          We are constantly changing and improving our services. We may add or
          remove functionalities or features, and we may suspend or stop a
          service altogether. You can stop using our services at any time,
          although we’ll be sorry to see you go. We may also stop providing
          services to you or add or create new limits to our services at any
          time.
        </p>
        <h2>Our Warranties and Disclaimers</h2>
        <p>
          We provide our services using a commercially reasonable level of skill
          and care, and we hope that you will enjoy using them. But there are
          certain things that we don’t promise about our services. Other than as
          expressly set out in these terms or additional terms, neither we nor
          our suppliers or distributors make any specific promises about the
          services. For example, we don’t make any commitments about the content
          within the services, the specific functions of the services, or their
          reliability, availability, or ability to meet your needs. We provide
          the services “as is”.
        </p>
        <h2>Liability for Our Services</h2>
        <p>
          When permitted by law, we, and our suppliers and distributors, will
          not be responsible for lost profits, revenues, or data, financial
          losses, or indirect, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive
          damages. To the extent permitted by law, the total liability of us,
          and our suppliers and distributors, for any claims under these terms,
          including for any implied warranties, is limited to the amount you
          paid us to use the services (or, if we choose, to supplying you the
          services again).
        </p>
        <h2>Business Uses of Our Services</h2>
        <p>
          If you are using our services on behalf of a business, that business
          accepts these terms. It will hold harmless and indemnify us and our
          affiliates, officers, agents, and employees from any claim, suit, or
          action arising from or related to the use of the services or violation
          of these terms, including any liability or expense arising from
          claims, losses, damages, suits, judgments, litigation costs, and
          attorneys’ fees.
        </p>
        <h2>About These Terms</h2>
        <p>
          We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a
          service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our
          services. You should look at the terms regularly. We’ll post notice of
          modifications to these terms on this page. We’ll post notice of
          modified additional terms in the applicable service. Changes will not
          apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen
          days after they are posted. However, changes addressing new functions
          for a service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective
          immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a service,
          you should discontinue your use of that service.
        </p>
        <h2>Governing Law</h2>
        <p>
          These terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
          of the State of [Your State], without regard to its conflict of law
          principles. You agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts
          located within [Your State] for the resolution of any disputes arising
          from these terms or the use of our services.
